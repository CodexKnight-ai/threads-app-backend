# Threads App – Backend

This repository contains the backend for a **Threads-like application**, built primarily as a **learning-focused project**.

## Purpose
The main motive of this backend is to **learn and practice**:
- **GraphQL** for flexible and efficient API design
- **Docker containerization** for consistent local development and environment management

This project is **not production-ready**. The focus is on understanding core backend concepts rather than building a fully scaled system.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js + Express
- Apollo Server (GraphQL)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker & Docker Compose

## Key Learnings
- Designing GraphQL schemas and resolvers
- Running services using Docker containers
- Managing PostgreSQL with Docker volumes
- Handling configuration via environment variables
